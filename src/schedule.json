This speech emphasizes that limited time doesn't mean limited impact—by focusing on essential character traits, leveraging high-intensity moments, and cutting unnecessary exposition, designers can create memorable, engaging characters that resonate with players. In the face of these constraints, characters must become storytelling tools themselves, propelling the plot and shaping player investment through every interaction.\r\n\r\nDrawing from my experience on Evil West, this session will offer insights into balancing intense action with meaningful character development. I'll highlight key strategies for making protagonists, antagonists, and supporting characters stand out in condensed narratives, where the room for extended character arcs is limited. We'll discuss how to effectively use key traits that bring characters to life, as well as the areas where we fell short due to the fast pace of the game.","takeaway":"Key Takeaways:\r\n1. How to Distill Essential Character Traits: In linear narratives like Evil West, you don't have time to explore every nuance of a character. Focus on essential traits that will resonate with the audience immediately. For example, your protagonist may be defined by a singular motivation, like vengeance or redemption, which informs all their actions, making them relatable and driving the plot forward. By concentrating on these fundamental qualities, you can avoid cluttering the narrative with excessive background detail.\r\n2. Techniques for Memorable Characters with Limited Screen Time: Instead of detailed character arcs, emphasize moments of intensity, create distinct visuals & combat style\r\n3. Streamlining Non-Essential Character Building: Players in action-heavy games don't want excessive backstory or slow exposition. Focus on dynamic characterization—using action and brief interactions to communicate who the characters are. Choose elements that serve the story and cut anything that doesn't enhance the immediate gameplay experience.\r\n4. Using characters as tools to highlight the story: When there's limited list of narrative tools, support the plot using the best of the existing characters. Ensure each character interaction propels the story forward, even when narrative depth is secondary to gameplay.\r\n\r\nOutcome: Attendees will gain clear, practical insights on how to craft engaging characters in fast-paced linear games. They'll learn to identify and prioritize essential character elements, cut non-essential details, and use concise but effective storytelling techniques to foster player connection, even in the most action-packed environments. These strategies will be immediately applicable to their own game development projects. As most narrative designers work under the time pressures, understanding how to craft effective characters with minimal narrative space will be crucial for creating narratives that stand out, no matter how action-driven the gameplay.","intended_audience":"This presentation is mostly tailored for narrative designers, game writers, and developers working on action-driven, linear games with limited narrative space.

Its screenshots may not look particularly impressive, nor even do short video clips. One of the things that makes Animal Well special is the secrets hidden throughout the world, but it was proving very difficult to communicate the feeling of uncovering secrets within the game without ruining them. We decided to demonstrate this feeling through the use of ARGs in which we buried puzzles within trailers and blog posts. This strategy was very effective in communicating what's special about the game while also giving our community something fun to engage with in exchange for their attention. But there was also a bit of a dark side. We noticed some people in our community chasing after shadows in ways we worried may not be healthy. We'll discuss how we approached this and some advice for others considering a similar strategy.","takeaway":"ARGs can be an effective and fun way to develop and engage with your community, but it's important to keep players' mental health in mind and maintain healthy boundaries.","intended_audience":"Marketers, independent developers.

Traditionally, creating these bots is a labor-intensive process, taking around four weeks per hero to define unique behaviors and difficulty levels. Our challenge was to automate this process to keep up with the game's frequent updates. We utilized reinforcement learning (RL) and self-play techniques, allowing bots to train by playing against existing scripted bots and themselves. This method proved to be efficient in getting bots that are good enough to hold their own against players. To tailor difficulty, we developed an action masking system, giving designers control over the RL bots which is normally a frequent issue with this kind of tech. Additionally, we combined RL with traditional scripted logic, like behavior trees, to create hybrid bots that integrate seamlessly into all game scenarios. These bots have gone through extensive testing to make sure they are up to par with their scripted counterpart and have now shipped in the game. This presentation will share our automated bot creation process, which drastically reduced development time required to make bots. We will also cover how the For Honor production is switching over to this new system for the creation of bots for future heroes. We also aim to provide practical insights into how ML and traditional AI can be synergized to streamline game development.","takeaway":"This is a case study of applying reinforcement learning to automate parts of a game production.

Game jams traditionally cater to seasoned developers, but integrating kids into events like these offers potential benefits for everyone involved. Adults benefit because kids' natural creativity and imagination are invaluable assets in innovative game design. Kids benefit because participation in a game jam encourages problem-solving, fosters creativity, and nurtures collaboration—skills vital not only in the game industry but also in many life situations. Moreover, an inclusive, game-centric event can spark early interest in STEM fields, opening pathways to future career prospects. However, involving kids in game development can introduce a number of challenges as well. Kids can get distracted or frustrated easily. In this way, making games with kids is a bit like making a cake with them; the key is to remember that kids do not possess the attention span or the skills to complete the process on their own (hat tip to Osama Dorias). Kids need a guide who can encourage them and focus their efforts on the parts they'll be excited about and they're good at. This session will enable participants to collaboratively brainstorm strategies and plans for structuring an asynchronous, distributed game jam that accommodates kids, ensuring a balance between guidance and creative freedom. Together, we will lay the foundation for an experience for kids that more than entertains—it also educates and inspires a new generation of potential game developers.","takeaway":"Participants in this roundtable session will gain practical strategies for engaging children in game development through creative collaboration.

Released in May 2024 by Digital Eclipse, the Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord video game is a remake of the 1981 game that inspired franchises like Baldur's Gate, Dragon Quest, and Final Fantasy. The original game had no musical score, so Phillips created new music that remained faithful to the 44-year-old game. In addition to her GRAMMY Award for this game, Phillips has also won the Society of Composers & Lyricists Award, the Telly Award, two Gold NYX Game Awards, and a Global Music Award for the Wizardry score. For this project, Phillips researched Medieval and Renaissance music, both style and instrumentation. Introducing orchestral anxiety into the music of the dungeon maze helped to keep things apprehensive. Combat music in Wizardry consisted of unnerving chromaticism, gestural flourishes and broad thematic statements reinforcing the epic stakes.

Traditionally, FPS restricts human-AI communication to simple commands like `attack' and `follow' due to the limitations of existing input methods such as hotkeys and command wheels. These commands lack specificity, hindering players from giving complex instructions like `clear the second floor' or `take cover behind that tree'. Arena Breakout enables players to interact with an AI companion called F.A.C.U.L. using natural language. F.A.C.U.L. can understand complex instructions, provide feedback, and perform a series of tasks.
