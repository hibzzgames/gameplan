# Gameplan
Gameplan is a simple web app I designed to help me plan out my GDC schedule and keep track of the talks I want to attend. The app is live on [gameplan.hibzz.games](https://gameplan.hibzz.games) and feel free to use it to plan your own GDC schedule! 
 
### Thoughts on the project:
- I wasn't super happy with the design of the official GDC app because I couldn't filter by timeslots, so I decided to make my own XÔπèX
- Started the project on thursday, with GDC starting on monday... So kinda stupid that I made this but sunk cost fallacy kicked in and I had to finish it lol
- I'm a gamedev and not a webdev, so I wrote it in a plain old vanilla JS. Please don't judge me for the code quality, I know it's not the best. I'm still learning! *Also, feel free to contribute to the project if you want to make it better!*
- Everything is stored locally and there's literally no backend. Source code is open, so feel free to check it out and see how it works (and judge me for my spaghetti code lol)
